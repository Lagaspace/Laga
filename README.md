*laga* is an all purpose library to create and design Genetic Algorithms (GAs). Originally _laga_ is my Ph.D. thesis conclusion, where I developed a series of GAs as a search and optimize tool for Architecture. At the beginning laga was written in different platforms. Some part in Rhinoscript, some part in C#.NET and GCScript. After my final Ph.D. presentation I decide to put all the algorithms in one strong and solid platform. I chose Java with the idea to create a flexible Genetic Algorithm library to use in different platforms, such as CAD software, Rhino, GC, GH, Blender, Excel, Processing, etc. (currently I am working in this feature).
<br/>
The laga name comes from _Librer√≠a de Algoritmos Geneticos para Arquitectura_. At the beginning the library was thought for architects, thus was designed very simple to use. Nevertheless is possible to apply laga to any type of problem. In order to use it you have to initialize each class from the {{{GenrChromosome();}}}(if is necessary) to {{{Replacement();}}}. Per each class choose the best method to fit your problem. You can combine them, or even use both different methods at the same time. 
For now laga only is stable in Java and Processing platform.
<br/>
In this web page you will find the latest current version of *laga* as well as examples, library documentation plus an Introduction of GAs. Also you can find the code to collaborate.
<br/>
If you are interested in laga or need to use it for some project or even if you plan to make a workshop about GAs and architecture, do not hesitate to write me.
