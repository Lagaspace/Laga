Once the individuals are selected and we have offspring with the parent inheritance the next operator in action is the mutation. The mutation consists in a random modification of the genes in the chromosome. This is doing for two reasons. The first reason is to increase the fitness value probabilities and the second is to include a big space search during the optimization process.
<br/>
The mutation modifies in a random way some genes in the chromosome and usually is applied to the offspring. Thus the GA imitates the nature, because when the parents pass the DNA to the sons, the copy generates some type of error. In the most cases this error don`t have big consequences. The mutation probability is always very small, around less than 1%. This is because the individuals after the mutation have a lower fitness. Also the mutation have to be very small because is necessary to keep the inheritance into the population. If the mutation is big is like to generate always random populations. In this case all the GA intelligence will be lost.
<br/>
The most common mutation is the random replacement. It consists in vary randomly a gene in the chromosome. If the chromosome is binary is possible to swap a 1 by 0 or vice versa. Also is possible to make the mutation changing values or un-sorted the chromosome. It is possible to multiply gen by a random value between min and max values.

The mutation only varies around the 1% in the chromosome. The mutation method used in the GA it will depends of the problem type, the conditions of the problem and the data type of the chromosome.
The crossover operator is charge of the fast search, while the mutation is charge to search in any nook of the space search. This operator earns more importance when the population increases their fitness, and the individuals are getting equals.
