Method Detail

NumberChromosome

public double[] NumberChromosome(int sizeChromosome,
                        double minParam,
                        double maxParam)
the method generate a number chromosome composed by random numbers between a minimum parameter and a maximum parameter. the method is based on double numbers.
Parameters:
sizeChromosome - -> the size of the chromosome
minParam - -> the smallest value in the chromosome
maxParam - -> the bigger value in the chromosome
Returns:
double random chromosome
NumberChromosome

public float[] NumberChromosome(int sizeChromosome,
                       float minParam,
                       float maxParam)
the method generate a number chromosome composed by random numbers between a minimum parameter and a maximum parameter. the method is based on float numbers.
Parameters:
sizeChromosome - -> the size of the chromosome
minParam - -> the smallest value in the chromosome
maxParam - -> the bigger value in the chromosome
Returns:
float list in the flavor: float[]
NumberChromosome

public int[] NumberChromosome(int sizeChromosome,
                     int minParam,
                     int maxParam)
the method generate a number chromosome composed by random numbers between a minimum parameter and a maximum parameter. the method is based on int numbers.
Parameters:
sizeChromosome - -> the size of the chromosome
minParam - -> the smallest value in the chromosome
maxParam - -> the bigger value in the chromosome
Returns:
int list in the flavor: int[]
BinaryChromosome

public int[] BinaryChromosome(int sizeChromosome)
This method generate a binary chromosome composed by 1s and 0s in random flavor...
Parameters:
sizeChromosome - -> the size of the population
Returns:
Integer list in the flavor: int[]
CharChromosome

public char[] CharChromosome(int sizeChromosome)
this method generate a character chromosome composed by lower case characters and spaces in a random flavor. composed by singles characters from a to z plus (space)
Parameters:
sizeChromosome - -> the size of the population
Returns:
char list in the flavor: char[]
NumberChromosomeSwap

public int[] NumberChromosomeSwap(int sizeChromosome)
the method generate a number chromosome composed by non repeated numbers between 0 and sizeChromosome(not inclusive). the method is based on integer numbers. this method is designed by combinatorial problems.
Parameters:
sizeChromosome - -> the size of the chromosome
Returns:
int list in the flavor: int[]
