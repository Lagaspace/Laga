= Codification =
<p align="justify">
Any problem or generative design that involves Genetic Algorithms needs a codification. The codification is the representation of a possible solution and usually is called chromosome. Is an analogy of the genetic code in the living creatures. In their simplest form the chromosome is represented by a list of parameters or values. Usually the chromosome is set by a binary list of 1s and 0s (1010111), and each parameter has a specific  number of bits into the list. Not all the parameters must be defined by the same number of bits. Also you can codify a possible solution by integers, real numbers, characters even points. The objective of the codification consist in helping the genetic operators do their job.

=== Chromosome example ===
<p align="justify">
We are designing a robotic leg to run faster. We actually have the leg design. Nevertheless we need to know the right parameters to find the best proportion of our leg. So we are going to use genetic algorithms to find the correct values. There are so many possibilities that GAs is the best approach.

The chromosome length is 5. Each value in the chromosome, represent a length and has a unique parameter in our design. If we change any of this values we are going to have a new design, ready to test. So after all we assume the design does not evolve, only dna does it.

So, modifying the values in the chromosome we have a new design. Each value is connected to one of the parameters in the design. Usually we call the design individual. The group of chromosomes or individuals is called population. in this case the population size is 8.
