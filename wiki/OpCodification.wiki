<p align="justify">
Any problem or generative design that involves Genetic Algorithms needs a codification. The codification is the representation of a possible solution and usually is called chromosome. Is an analogy of the genetic code in the living creatures. In their simplest form the chromosome is represented by a list of parameters or values. Usually the chromosome is set by a binary list of 1s and 0s (1010111), and each parameter has a specific  number of bits into the list. Not all the parameters must be defined by the same number of bits. Also you can codify a possible solution by integers, real numbers, characters even points. The objective of the codification consist in helping the genetic operators do their job.

We are designing a robotic leg to run faster. We actually have the design. Nevertheless we need to know the right parameters to find the best proportion in our leg. So we are going to use genetic algorithms to find the correct values. There are so many possiblities that GAs is the best approach.
