It does not exist a definition of "Genetic Algorithms" accepted by all, However, most methods called GAs have at least the following elements in common: population of chromosomes, selection according to fitness function, crossover with offspring and random mutation.

The most common application of GAs is the optimization task. The goal is to find the correct values for a list of parameters in a function. The fitness function depends of the problem to optimize and can goes from find a simple value like a distance to resolve complex functions where all the parameters are related and is not possible to maximize one of it without to minimize others.

Computer Scientist define the collection of all possible solutions to a problem as a "search space". Suppose we want to design a protein with similar performance as collagen.
