It does not exist a definition of "Genetic Algorithms" accepted by all, However, most methods called GAs have at least the following elements in common: population of chromosomes, selection according to fitness function, crossover with offspring and random mutation.

The most common application of GAs is the optimization task. The goal is to find the correct values for a list of parameters in a function. The fitness function depends of the problem to optimize and can goes from find a simple value like a distance to resolve complex functions where all the parameters are related and is not possible to maximize one of it without to minimize others.

Computer Scientist define the collection of all possible solutions to a problem as a "search space". Suppose we want to design a protein with similar performance as collagen. The search space is the collection of all possible sequences of protein with length 100 and we have 26 possible amino-acids by letters in each gen of the chromosome.

The mutation only varies around the 1% in the chromosome. The mutation method used in the GA it will depends of the problem type, the conditions of the problem and the data type of the chromosome.
The crossover operator is charge of the fast search, while the mutation is charge to search in any nook of the space search. This operator earns more importance when the population increases their fitness, and the individuals are getting equals.
