It does not exist a definition of "Genetic Algorithms" accepted by all, However, most methods called GAs have at least the following elements in common: population of chromosomes, selection according to fitness function, crossover with offspring and random mutation.
<br/>
The most common application of GAs is the optimization task. The goal is to find the correct values for a list of parameters in a function. The fitness function depends of the problem to optimize and can goes from find a simple value like a distance to resolve complex functions where all the parameters are related and is not possible to maximize one of it without to minimize others.
<br/>
Computer Scientist define the collection of all possible solutions to a problem as a _"search space"_. Suppose we want to design a protein with similar performance as collagen. The search space is the collection of all possible sequences of protein with length 100 and we have 26 possible amino-acids by letters in each gen of the chromosome.

<p align="justify">
Since the search space it is so big that use GAs is a clever chance to find a very good result. Each candidate solution will look like this:
ABCDDEDFRLLGA...
An algorithm for search in this space is an effective method for choosing which candidate solutions to test in each generation of the run time. Genetic Algorithms combine via crossover and mutation the high quality candidate solutions from different regions in the search space. The search space is the collection of candidate solutions to a problem. in this case all the possibilities to have to design our collagen protein.

== Fitness Landscape ==
<p align="justify">
The fitness landascape is a representation of the space of all possible genotypes along with their fitness. The fitness landscape can be seen as a surface with valleys and peaks. Imagine a range mountain where the population is travelling, and looking for the highest peak. Valleys represents the the low quality solutions and the highest peak the high-quality solution in the space search. 
<br/>
Since is a mountain range it is possible to find "peaks", "hills" and "valleys". Only one peak will contain the best fitness and is called _Best Global_ or _Global Optimum_ all the others peaks and hills are called _Best Local_ or _Local Optimum_, where their fitness is the best in the zone but not in search space. Evolution causes populations to move along the landscape in particular ways, and adaptation can be seen as the movement toward local peaks. Some times is not necessarily the highest point in the landscape, but any small.
<br/>
In GAs the operators of crossover and mutation can be seen as ways of moving a population on the landscape defined by the fitness function. The idea of the evolution moving  population around fixed landscape is no realistic for several reasons. In the real world the landscape is not separated from the organisms that inhabit it.

== Fitness Function ==
<p align="justify">
The chromosomes in GAs tipically are composed if bit strings. Each gen in the chromosome has two possibility 0 or 1. Each chromosome can be represented as a point in the search space of candidate solutions. The GA processes populations of chromosomes, successively replacing by new generations. The GAs most often requires a fitness function to determine a fitness of each chromosome in the current population. The fitness of a chromosome depends on how well that chromosome solves the problem.
<br/>
One common application of GAs is function optimization, where the goal is to find a set of parameters values that maximize a multy-parameter function or one real dimensional function.
<br/>
lets see an example of Melanie Mitchell
<br/>
{{{f(y) = y + |Sin(32y)|}}}
<br/>
The candidate solutions are values of y. Each individual is encoded as bit string representing the real numbers (0 ≤ y < π). Is necessary to translate the bit string _x_ into a real number _y_ and the evaluate the value. Finally the fitness of string is the function value at that point.
<br/>
Going back to the above problem, we can define the fitness of a individual as the negative of the potential energy of the sequence with respect to the desire protein structure. The potential energy is a measure of how much physical resistance the sequence would put if forced to be folded into the desire structure. The lower energy, the higher fitness.
<br/>
The important thing here is understand that the individuals are encoded as abstract chromosome of numbers or letters or both. The fitness function is defined to evaluate each chromosome and assign a value to determine how it fit in the fitness landscape.

== Search Methods ==
<p align="justify">
We can find (at least) three search types.
</p>
 # Search for Sorted Data
<p align="justify">
Imagine we have a list of 1000 numbers, and is necessary find the closer to 20. {-623, -345, -34, 16, 56, 500, 845,…} we start with the -623, then we move it to -345 and so on to 16. Since the algorithm don´t know what is the next number it continues to 56, but the result is lower than 16. so the algorithm return 16 and finish the search. _Binary Search_ is one method for efficiently finding the desire record in a sorted list.
</p>
 # Search for Paths to Objective
<p align="justify">
The problem here consists in find the correct set of actions that will move for an initial state to a given goal. This types of algorithms are the central of many artificial intelligence methods.
</p>
 # Search for Solutions
<p align="justify">
The idea here is more abstract. Find (efficiently) a solution to a problem in a large space of candidate solutions. These are the kinds of search problems for which genetic algorithms are used. The cool thing here is when we search a space of candidate solutions with a GA, not all the possible solutions are created first and the evaluated; rather, the GA is a method for finding optimal or good solutions by examining a small fraction (pollster) of the possible candidates.
