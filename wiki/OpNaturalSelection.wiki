= Natural Selection =
<p align="justify">
There are many ways to select the best individuals in a population. Some methods are exclusive, but others can be combined with selection strategies. The natural selection algorithm is the operator who decide  which individuals are going to have a chance to crossover and who don`t. The possibility to be selected is extremely related with the fitness of the chromosome. We can not select always the most fit and reject the others, because the populations turns homogenic and will not search in the whole space solution, thus we are going to have a fast convergence and a not so good result.
<br/>
There are many natural selection algorithms, but all of them are based in the fitness evaluation. The natural selection must allow best individuals have more chances to offspring that worst. The "genes" of the best individuals are going to spread faster in the population than the others.
<br/>
There are many different natural selection algorithms and in almost all  cases are customized to face up specific problems. Some of them looks the lower computational resource, others deals with different select ranges, etc. The natural selection algorithm will determine the GA search strategy. If we select a high pressure selection method the search will be focus near to best individuals in the population. In the other hand if we select a low pressure selection method, we are going to leave many open roads to explore in the search space.

=== Elitism Selection ===
<p align="justify">
This method select only the best ranked individuals in the population. Nevertheless the most GAs do not use this technique, in fact they use a modified elitism selection algorithm. This technique is not very useful because you get an early convergence in the population. The important thing is to ensure select some individuals with low fitness.

<p align="justify">
In this case only the first 5 individuals ranked in the population are going to be selected 10 times each. Since all of them has more than less the same fitness, The selected individuals are quite similar. this mean that the GA will search in small portion of the space search.

=== Roulette Wheel ===
<p align="justify"> 
The Roulette Wheel selection, probably is the most used technique in GAs. The selection of the individuals is proportional to their fitness. Each individual in the population has a chance to be selected for the next generation. The individuals in the top of the ranking (best fitness) will have more chance of be selected than the other with less fitness value.

Each individual in the population is assigned a piece of the roulette, proportional to their fitness. This mean the sum of all percents is equal to the whole value of the roulette. The individuals with high fitness will have a bigger percent in the roulette. Usually the top individuals are in the beginning of the roulette an so on to complete the graph. In order to make the selection is possible to generate a random number between 0 and the size of the roulette. The method is simple but no so useful when you work with big populations.

Is possible make modification of the traditional roulette wheel

Cada uno de los individuos de la población se le asigna una parte de la ruleta, proporcional a su fitness. De tal forma que la suma de todos los porcentajes sea el valor total de la ruleta. Los mejores individuos recibirán una porción de la ruleta mayor que la de los peores individuos. Usualmente los mejores individuos, se encuentran al principio de la ruleta y para seleccionar se genera un número aleatorio entre 0 y el tamaño de la ruleta. Es un método simple pero se vuelve ineficiente cuando se trabajan con grandes poblaciones.
Usualmente el tamaño de la ruleta, la cantidad de individuos que contendrá, no es un valor fijo, pero si es necesario definir el la cantidad de veces en que el mejor individuo será seleccionado. Esto se hace para reducir costos computacionales y controlar el porcentaje de selección de los peores individuos. La selección de este tipo suele representarse por una curva no polinómica de la forma y = 1/x.
