= Natural Selection =
<p align="justify">
There are many ways to select the best individuals in a population. Some methods are exclusive, but others can be combined with selection strategies. The natural selection algorithm is the operator who decide  which individuals are going to have a chance to crossover and who don`t. The possibility to be selected is extremely related with the fitness of the chromosome. We can not select always the most fit and reject the others, because the populations turns homogenic and will not search in the whole space solution, thus we are going to have a fast convergence and a not so good result.

There are many natural selection algorithms, but all of them are based in the fitness evaluation. The natural selection must allow best individuals have more chances to offspring that worst. The "genes" of the best individuals are going to spread faster in the population than the others.
<br/>
There are many different natural selection algorithms and in almost all  cases are customized to face up specific problems. Some of them looks the lower computational resource, others deals with different select ranges, etc. The natural selection algorithm will determine the GA search strategy. If we select a high pressure selection method the search will be focus near to best individuals in the population. In the other hand if we select a low pressure selection method, we are going to leave many open roads to explore in the search space.

=== Elitism Selection ===
<p align="justify">
This method select only the best ranked individuals in the population. Nevertheless the most GAs do not use this technique, in fact they use a modified elitism selection algorithm. This technique is not very useful because you get an early convergence in the population. The important thing is to ensure select some individuals with low fitness.
