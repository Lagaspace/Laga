public Class Mutation, extends Object
<br>
The Mutation class has all the methods to create and initialize different flavors of mutations on individuals, (not implemented yet).
<br>
<br>
<br>
==Constructor Summary== 
Constructor and Description:
<br>
One constructor.
<br>
{{{Mutation(PApplet parent, float MutationRate)}}}
The constructor takes two parameters, the first is the parent for processing and the second is the mutation percent in the population.
<br>
_tip: always a small number closer to 0._
<br>
 * Parameters:
    # {{{MutationRate}}}: range fo mutation percent in the population.
<br>
<br>
{{{public Object[][] MutationSwap(Object[][] population, float percentChrom)}}}
<br>
MutationSwap method. this method swap two or more alleles in the chromosome, same as RNA does in the DNA Don't forget implement a float parameter in the constructor.
<br>
 * Parameters:
    # {{{population}}}: population to be mutated.
    # {{{percentChrom}}}: percent mutation in the chromsome 0 <= percentChrom <= 1.
    # {{{return}}}: Object[][] population.
<br>
<br>
{{{public double[][] NumbMutation(double[][] pop, double min, double max, float percentChrom)}}}
<br>
MutationSwap method. this method swap two or more alleles in the chromosome, same as RNA does in the DNA Don't forget implement a float parameter in the constructor.
<br>
 * Parameters:
    # {{{population}}}: population to be mutated.
    # {{{percentChrom}}}: percent mutation in the chromsome 0 <= percentChrom <= 1.
    # {{{return}}}: double[][] population.
<br>
<br>
{{{float[][] NumbMutation(float[][] pop, float min, float max, float percentChrom)}}}
<br>
MutationSwap method. this method swap two or more alleles in the chromosome, same as RNA does in the DNA Don't forget implement a float parameter in the constructor.
<br>
 * Parameters:
    # {{{population}}}: population to be mutated.
    # {{{percentChrom}}}: percent mutation in the chromsome 0 <= percentChrom <= 1.
    # {{{return}}}: float[][] population.
<br>
<br>
{{{int[][] NumbMutation(int[][] pop, int min, int max, float percentChrom)}}}
<br>
MutationSwap method. this method swap two or more alleles in the chromosome, same as RNA does in the DNA Don't forget implement a float parameter in the constructor.
<br>
 * Parameters:
    # {{{population}}}: population to be mutated.
    # {{{percentChrom}}}: percent mutation in the chromsome 0 <= percentChrom <= 1.
    # {{{return}}}: int[][] population.
<br>
<br>
{{{char[][] CharMutation(char[][] pop, float ChroPercent)}}}
<br>
The Method GenrMutation() takes two arguments. the population that is going to be mutated and the percent of the chromosome mutated.
<br>
 * Parameters:
    # {{{pop}}}: the population that is going to be mutated;
    # {{{Chromosomepercent}}}: the percent rate in the chromosome that is going to be mutated.
    # {{{return}}}: a mutated population in the passed flavor.
